## Tree in formal language and compiler design

If you have read book describe the **compiler technology**, for example the classic definitive book [Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools) by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman, you will be aware how important the tree structure is to the compiler. As described in chapter 2.2.3 Parse Trees:

> Tree data structures figure prominently in compiling.

There are some many tree in the book, such as [Parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree), [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), activation tree(in chapter 7.2.1 Activation Trees), [expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree).

Essentially Speaking, a **programming language** is a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language), what have been concluded in article structure is that 

>  Tree can be used to describe the structure of [sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)) that is  [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) and  [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) can be convert to [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)).

So it's natural to use trees in the compiling.

[Regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), [algebraic expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression) can be described using  [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar), so given an expression, it can be converted to an equivalent  [parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree).



[Derivations and syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar#Derivations_and_syntax_trees)对此的解释是非常好的。

Tree is then merely implicit in the parser's actions.
