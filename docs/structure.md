我们使用data structure来保存数据，那么是否想过这样的问题：数据有哪些结构呢？显然，对结构的研究有助于我们选择合适的data structure来保存我们的数据，并且只有当我们知道事物结构后，才能够使用计算机来处理它。structure是一个宏大的话题，在这篇文章中，我仅仅从[computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)的角度来探讨structure.

# [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical) 

[Hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical) structure is common in computer science.

# structure of sentence

In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), [**syntax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of [sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)) (**sentence structure**) in a given [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language), usually including [word order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order). The term *syntax* is also used to refer to the study of such principles and processes.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax#cite_note-Chomsky_def-3) The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the [syntactic rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar) common to all languages.

Studies of the [syntactical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) aspects of languages(their internal **structural patterns**)  belongs to the [theory of formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language). In theory of formal language, [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) is used to describe structure of [sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)), that is [**syntax**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) .  [Formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) such as a [regular grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grammar) or [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), consists of its [formation rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_rule). The first step to describing the meaning of an utterance in language is to break it down part by part and look at its analyzed form (known as its [parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree) in computer science, and as its [deep structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_structure_and_surface_structure) in [generative grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar)).

[Parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree)  is used in compiler, which reveal to us that tree can be used to describe the structure of [sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)) that is  [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) and  [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) can be convert to [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)).
