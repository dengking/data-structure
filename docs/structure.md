# 前言

我们使用data structure来保存数据，那么是否想过这样的问题：数据有哪些结构呢？显然，对结构的研究有助于我们选择合适的data structure来保存我们的数据，并且只有当我们知道事物结构后，才能够使用计算机来处理它。structure是一个宏大的话题，在这篇文章中，我仅仅从[computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)的角度来探讨structure.

# [Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure)

A **structure** is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System), or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as [buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building) and [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine) and natural objects such as [biological organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism), [minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral) and [chemicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance). Abstract structures include [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [musical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_form). Types of structure include a [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy) (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network) featuring many-to-many [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(geometry)), or a [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)) featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.

> NOTE: In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), [tree (data structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) is often used to describe  [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy)  structure, [graph(data structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) is often used to describe  [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network) structure.

In computer science, structure is everywhere:

- [Data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

- [Software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)

> NOTE: 对结构的分析，是一种全局的、高屋建瓴的分析。

## [Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical) 

[Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical) structure is common in computer science, it often appears as a [tree structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure), which will be described in `tree` chapter.
