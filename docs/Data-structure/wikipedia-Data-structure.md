# [Data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

A **data structure** is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency) access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of [data values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

> NOTE: [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency) can be measured by [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) and [space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity).



## Data structure VS [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) (ADT)

Data structures serve as the basis for [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.

> NOTE: This can be thought as separating interface and implementation, ADT is interface and concrete data structure is implementation. 



## Usage

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) commonly use [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) indexes for data retrieval, while [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) implementations usually use [hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) to look up identifiers.

> NOTE: So how to choose data structure ? It is an art and worth learning.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) and [internet indexing services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_indexing). Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). Some formal design methods and [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both [main memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory) and [secondary memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_memory).
