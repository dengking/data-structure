# Tree structure

直观地感受tree，看看维基百科[Tree structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure)

A **tree structure** or **tree diagram** is a way of representing the [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy) nature of a [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure) in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic [representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure#Representing_trees) resembles a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree), even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the "part of the plant in the ground" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.
