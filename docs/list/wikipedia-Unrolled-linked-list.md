 展开的链表 

In computer programming, an **unrolled linked list** is a variation on the [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) which stores multiple elements in each node. It can dramatically increase [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) performance, while decreasing the memory overhead associated with storing list metadata such as [references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference). It is related to the [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree).
