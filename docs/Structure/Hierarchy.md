# Hierarchy

阅读维基百科的[Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy)的笔记，主要是想搞清楚hierarchy和tree structure之间的关联。

A **hierarchy** (from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) *hierarkhia*, "rule of a high priest", from *[hierarkhes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(officer))*, "president of sacred rites") is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another. 

A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior（上级） or to one of one's subordinates（下属）, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. Hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory)). All parts of the hierarchy that are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be "horizontally" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. This is akin to two [co-workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-worker) or [colleagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrade) （同一层）; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. [Heterarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy) is one such form.

“hierarchy”的中文意思是“层级”，我们平时常常所说的“等级”与它的含义类似。Hierarchy概念所强调的是level以及level之间的关系（above-below关系或superior-subordinates关系）。可以将Hierarchy看做是一种结构（元素和元素之间的关系），Hierarchy的关系为above-below关系、superior-subordinates关系。

Hierarchy结构，如果使用computer science 语言来描述的话，那么它类似于graph structure。

Hierarchy结构，如果使用math 语言来描述的话，那么它类似于[partially ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set) ，参见原文[Mathematical representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Mathematical_representation)章节。





## Hierarchy and data structure

Hierarchy and data structure可以使用tree 或者 graph 来进行表示。
